Project 5! Optimizing Evacuation Routes using Real-Time Traffic Information



### Problem Statement:

During disasters, search and rescue teams must be able to search for and get to survivors as fast as possible (in terms of travel time and distance)
Current GIS and navigation systems allow responders to calculate travel time and distance between origin and destination and propose an optimal route to the destination.
However, many of the current platforms do not rely on real-time data (e.g. road closures, damaged roads etc.) and can produce inaccurate or inefficient results.
This project will leverage social media, news feeds and other datasets (e.g. Waze, Here.com) to identify real time road closures or damaged roads, power outages and other blocked routes that may affect traffic lights, travel time, travel safety and more.
The system should allow the user (the public or rescue teams) to search for any of these conditions and identify if and where they exist in a specific location (street, neighborhood, city etc.)


### Desired Deliverables:

A short write-up describing the project.

An open source code that pulls live information from social media and/or news feeds about road closures, road conditions, damaged roads, power outages etc. which may affect travel and accessibility.

The output can be either tabular (e.g. allow for search of names of closed roads) or geospatial (e.g. produce a map of real-time road closures).

## General Prompt:

### Overview
We've organized for you to complete a client project. This is a great opportunity for you to be exposed to a real organization doing real work with real data.

### The Organization:

New Light Technologies is a small, award-winning organization based in Washington, D.C. that provides solutions to government, commercial, and non-profit clients. NLT is a team of dedicated technologists, scientists, engineers, designers, and strategists working on some of the most interesting, challenging, and important assignments in the world, ranging from disaster response to enabling growing telecommunications networks to providing healthcare to Americans. Some of the organizations they work with include FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency), USAID (the United States Agency for International Development), the U.S. Census Bureau, and The World Bank.

Ran Goldblatt, our contact with NLT, is a remote sensing scientist and senior consultant. He has a strong background in geographic information systems (GIS) and leverages this knowledge when solving problems facing various agencies.

### The Work:

For this project, you will be doing work that focuses on:

preparing for emergencies,
rapidly responding to emergencies, and/or
estimating the economic impact of disasters.
The goal is for you to leverage your skills to help solve real-world problems. NLT has identified twelve potential prompts of value to them. You may pick one and attempt to solve it. Alternatively, if you would like to edit the problem slightly (for example, picking a different data source) or combine multiple prompts together, you may do that as well!
